/*  Algorithm for full class function-
    1. Take in a 2d array, number of rows, and number of students on the waitlist as parameters for the function
    2. Check if the array has a valid amount of rows, if the number of rows is 0, then print the original amount of sutdents on the waitlist 
    3. If the number of arrays is larger than 0, then enter a for loop that iterates through the 2d array
    4. There will be an outer for loop that iterates through the rows of the array, and an inner for loop that iterates through the columns
    5. Once in the inner for loop, check if the element in the current iterations column is a 0 and if the waitlist has already reached 0
    6. If the element is a 0 and the waitlist still has students in it, then enter the if statement.
    7. In the if statement, replace the 0 with a 1 and subtract 1 from the waitlist value. Then print out the element.
    8. If the element isn't a 0 or the waitlist has reached 0, then print out the current value in the array and continue to the next iteration
    9. Once out of the inner for loop for a column, print a return character to go to the next row.
    10. Once out of the outer for loop, print out the remaining students on the waitlist.
    11. Then return the waitlist value.
