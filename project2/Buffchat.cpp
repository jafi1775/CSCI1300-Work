/* Algorithm for readposts function:
    1. Define an input stream variable, an integar for the number of likes in a posy and the return value of the split function. Also define a string array, and string variable to hold the line from the getline function.
    2. Open the file given.
    3. Check if there is room for the array to be filled, if there isn't return -2.
    4. Check if the file fails, if it does return -1.
    5. If the file doesn't enter either if statment then continue throuhg code.
    6. Create a while loop that runs while there is still info to read from the file and that the posts arraqy size is larger than the number of posts.
    7. In the while loop, call the getline function on file. 
    7. If the line for this iterations getline is empty, skip to next iteration.
    8. Clear the temperary array used for the split function.
    9. Call the split function and set it equal to a variable.
    10. If the split function doesn't return 4 (the correct amount of information to be split), then continue to next line.
    11. Then convert the number of likes from a string to an integar.
    12. Fill a temperary Post variable with the information found.
    13. Add temporary post varibale to post array at the index of the number of posts in the array.
    14. Increase the number of posts variable by one after post is added.
    15. Outside of while loop, close the file and return the number of posts.

/*  Algorithm for count Unique Likes:
    1. Declare a boolean variable that will check if the post has been viewed, and a variable that will count the number of likes.
    2. If the number of posts and number of users are both 0, return -2.
    3. Enter a for loop that will iterate through the posts array.
    4. If the author of the current post in the for loop matches that of the post author specifed enter another for loop that will iterate through the users array.
    5. In the inner for loop, check if the likes value for the specified post is above or equal to 0.
    6. If it is equal to or above 0, check if it is above 0 (if it has been liked).
    7. If the post has been liked by this user, increment the likes by 1.
    8. Then set the boolean variable to true, to show that the post has been viewed by at least one person regardless of likes.
    9. Outside these loops, if the boolean vaiable is still false, then return -1.
    10. Otherwise, return the number of unique likes by returning the likes counter variable.
