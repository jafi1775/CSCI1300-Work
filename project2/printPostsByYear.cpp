/*  Algorithm for printPostsByYear-
    1. Take in specified perameters.
    2. Define variable int matches, string date, and string year_of_posts.
    3. Check if num_posts_stored is less than or equal to 0, if it is print that no posts are stored.
    4. Elsem enter a for loop that iterates through each post element of the post array.
    5. In the for loop, define date as the post element at this iterations index, with the getter for the date of the post.
    6. Then, define year_of_post as a substring of year that only takes the year of the string.
    7. Check if the year of the post is the same as the year being searched for.
    8. If it is, check if this is the first match of year to be found, if it is print out the preliminary statement to the list.
    9. Else, print out this iterations post body with the getter for the post body.
    10. Then, increment the number of matched by 1 in the if statement.
    11. After the for loop, if their were no matches then print out that there were no posts stored for that year.
    12. Return nothing.
